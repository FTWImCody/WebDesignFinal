	<h1>Evolution of Technology in Gaming</h1>
	<p>Over the years gaming technology has advanced by a lot! Starting with some of the first steps into gaming being playing cards, board games and then of course video games. In the next few webpages I will be summing up the generations of gaming over the decades. I will be covering both the interest in gaming and the technology in consoles on each webpage.</p>
	<p>Everything from Nintendo starting out as a playing cards company and today being one of the most innovative game console creators to the "almost" downfall of video games in 1983.</p>
	<p>Each webpage will cover a decade of gaming starting in the 50-60s and then 70s onwards all the way up to 2018.</p>
