	<p>Nintendo, still holding onto their lead in the hand held market, created the next device named Nintendo 3DS which came paired with a screen that allowed the user to see the games in 3D without any of those funny loooking glasses. This is one of the most owned devices in the current generation of gaming consoles. Sony once again tried their hand at the hand held gaming market with their release of the Playstation Vita, which could be connected to a cellular network to provide internet connectivity anywhere you had cell phone service. Later Sony would abandone the Vita and continue development on home gaming consoles.</p>
	<p>Once again, Nintendo released another home gaming console which was a successor to the Wii. This device was a huge failure in home gaming. Not really bringing too much new to the plate within technology besides a secondary screen allowing gameplay on both the TV and the controller itself. The Wii U allowed Nintendo to step back and rethink their design for a later rendition of a home gaming console that would become a huge hit. Sony released their new home gaming console in 2013 and still today they continue to sell games and consoles. The playstation would be the most sold home gaming console of the eighth-gen consoles falling just short of the Nintendo 3DS for most sold overall in the eighth-gen consoles.</p>

	<p>Microsoft being the third company still standing in the gaming industry released their Xbox One. Why they didn't call it Xbox 720 or something? No one knows. The Xbox One hasn't sold as many units as the Playstation 4 or Nintendo DS but still has plenty of people playing it. Nintendo finally released another console like the Wii's original release that sold out on the release day and was sold out for months after. This new gaming console is called Nintendo Switch. It gets it's name from the fact you can switch between handheld, desktop and home console modes seamlessly. You can play the console hand held with the joy-con connected to the screen, in desktop mode with the screen disconnected from the joy-cons or in home console mode with the screen in a docking station connected to a TV and playing using the joy-cons. Also the device is charged while in the docking station. This is a widely successful console because it can be played while on a trip, sitting in your room or even with a group of friends crowded around a table.
	<p>Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft seem to be the only people creating new consoles for the video game market but what will the future bring? Will we see Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo still dominating the market or will some one new come out I guess we will have to see.
