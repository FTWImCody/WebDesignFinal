	<p>A lot happened in the 70s that would spark the dawn of video games as we know them today. Advancements in technology as well as even more consoles being created for the market. We will also see a return of The "Brown Box" created by Ralph Baer in 1967 renamed to Magnavox's Odyssey. As well as some new names into the gaming world.</p>
	<p>Starting out the 70s with Computer Space, which was a arcade version of a game developed in the 60s called "Spacewar!" but the controls were too difficult to learn so it didn't really catch on. Arcades got their next chance at video games in 1972 with Pong. Any gamer nowadays should know what Pong is because it's what most of us see as the first video game. Pong was created by Atari, who was founded by Nolan Bushnell(aka the godfather of video games). Pong was extremely successful and ushered in the new wave of gaming. No longer were people rushing to the tables to play card and board games but instead were rushing to the nearest mall, bar, bowling alley or pizza shop to play Pong. </p>

	<p>Intel's creation of the first microprocessor would open up the doors to new consoles and games for home use. Instead of having to go spend money on arcade machines, you could have your own personal gaming device in your home. In 1977, Atari released the Atari VCS, better known as Atari 2600, which was the first game console with microprocessor-based hardware and a ROM cartridge with game code on it. The console came bundled with 2 joystic controllers, a conjoined paddle controller and usually a game called Combat.</p>
