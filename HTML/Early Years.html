	<p>In the early years of gaming, there were basically playing cards and board games but in 1940 the first "game machine" was shown at a world fair in New York. The machine was a recreation of an ancient game called Nim, which was played by many people in the half a year it was on display. Although, the first commercially home owned game system was not developed until 1967 by Ralph Baer. The name for this device was dubbed the "Brown Box".</p>

	<p>The "Brown Box" was able to be programmed to play a number of games on a television. Games that could be played on the television were ping pong, checkers and sports games. The "Brown Box" used a controller to allow users to control cubes on their TVs. This was the first example of a home owned video game system. Because of the little amount of technology in the "Brown Box", they had to package along score cards, like bowling or golf score cards, in the box because there was no memory to store scores. The only technology the "Brown Box" provided was white dots and lines on a television. This device was later sold to Magnavox and was renamed to the Magnavox Odyssey.</p>
	<p>Very little was done in the advancement in technology until early 1970s. Some of the things that came after the "Brown Box" were electro-mechanical arcade games throughout 1966 to early 1970s when we would see the true beginning of video games. </p>
