	<p>One of the biggest hit games for the Atari VCS came out in 1980. That game was Space Invaders, a game also known to many gamers and still played to this day as a time passing game. It was at this time in the early 80s that multiple hobbyist magazines were created around technology and video games such as Computer and Video Games and Computer Gaming World in 1981. The ColecoVision was released on August 1982 and was more powerful than it's previous and game with the initial catalog of 12 games. One of which happened to be Nintendo's Donkey Kong. The ColecoVision was another console that had ROM cartridges for the games. </p>
	<p>Unfortunately the 1980s saw one of the worse times for video games throughout the generations. The market was at an all time high, people were creating new consoles and games left and right, but the over saturation of video games that were low quality caused the gaming market to crash and burn for a while. One of the most well known facts about this time was that ET the movie had a game made after it that was so bad they literally took dump trucks full of the games and buried them somewhere in the middle of a desert. To this day people still believe that Atari didn't really bury all these games in the deserts of New Mexico. This event was known as the North American video game crash of 1983.</p>

	<p>After the video game crash of 1983, by 1984 all video game consoles were discontinued except for the Intellivision which was bought out by Mattel Electronics. Nintendo finally coming in with a big deal for the video game industry at the time with the Game Boy. The first device that was hand held and could play a number of video games.</p>
