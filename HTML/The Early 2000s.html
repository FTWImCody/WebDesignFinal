	<p>The early 2000s was a big game changer for all the generations of gamers. The release of online games were on the rise and the most sold console to this date was released in early 2000s. Sony's playstation 2 was announced in 1999 and was released in 2000. This console was a huge success and would put Sony at the top of console sales. The playstation 2 was a direct competitor to the Sega Dreamcast and was way more of a success than the Dreamcast.</p>
	<p>Up until 2001, there wasn't much talk about massively online games. That was until RuneScape's release in 2001. RuneScape's developers started development on a MUD(Multi user Dungeon) with graphics. There were plenty of MUDs at the time where people could connect through a text based adventure but RuneScape's developers added graphics to the adventure creating the first MMORPG(Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game). Online gameplay and better graphics started to expand because of the internet capabilities and microprocessors allowed more.</p>
	<p>Nintendo trying their hardest to stay relevant in the console world fired back at Sony's Playstation 2 with the Gamecube. It didn't outsell the Playstation 2 but was still successful within the Nintendo community. At this time Microsoft had no part in the gaming consoles industry other than the computer software and a few computer games. In 2001, Microsoft would release the Xbox. Although a success, it still didn't outdo it's competitor. Sony still came out on top in the early 2000s. Nintendo realised the market they were capable of holding was the hand held gaming market. So, they released another hand held named Game Boy Advance, the successor of the Game Boy released in earlier years.</p>
	<p>Microsoft was happy with their attempts at their first console so in 2005 they released the Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 was the direct successor of Xbox and became one of the widely popular consoles with the ability to play online and have expandable storage attached as a hard drive to the unit. Xbox Live Marketplace was also released with the Xbox 360 and allowed gamers to connect to the internet with their friends and chat in "parties", as well as, download games straight to their Xbox after purchasing them from the marketplace. Sony then released the Playstation 3 in 2006. At this point the only 3 companies who run the console market are Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. Nintendo then released the Wii. This was the first console I can remember personally being sold out for months after it's release. Nintendo being as innovative as they are released the Wii as a way to get gamers moving. The console came with a motion tracking bar that would track motion from the controllers. This allowed a lot of new things in games and was a huge success for getting gamers moving and even people who wouldn't call themselves gamers were playing the Wii.</p>

	<p>Nintendo, still dominating the hand held market, released  their new hand held named the Nintendo DS. It was a console with two screens. One of the screens were touch and the other one was only visual. Sony wanted their hand in the hand held market so in 2005, they released the Playstation Portable. Just like the Playstation 2, it ran games off of a CD-ROM and could play movies too. It also had online capabilities so you could download games directly onto a micro-sd card and play them wherever you go.</p>
